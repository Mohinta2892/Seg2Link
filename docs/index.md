# Welcome to Seg2Link

- Seg2Link is a program designed to semi-automatically segment 3D EM images. 
It takes an inaccurate deep learning cell/non-cell prediction as input 
and assists users in quickly transforming the prediction into accurate cell segmentation. 
- To go along with it, we also provide Seg2Link-unet2d, a program for training deep neural networks to predict cellular/non-cellular regions.

- This user guide applies to [*Seg2Link 0.1.2*]() and [*Seg2Link-unet2d 0.2.0*](https://pypi.org/project/seg2link-unet2d/)
