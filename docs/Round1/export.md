### *Export 3D segmentation result*

- After you've finished the semi-automatic segmentations in all slices,
   press the button "Export segmentation as .npy file" to export the 3D segmentation as a 3D array file (.npy format).
- By default, the result is saved in the folder that the user has previously specified in the [parameter setting](parameter_setting.md). We advise users not to change the folder.
