# Frequently asked questions
**Q1: The software crashes when I press a hotkey more than once. Why?**

A1: Requesting the execution of a new operation before the previous operationÂ has finished can cause the program to crash. Please wait until the previous instruction has been finished.

**Q2: The layout of the main window is incorrect. Why?**

A2: One possible explanation is that your monitor's resolution is insufficient. We recommend that users use a monitor with at least 1920 x 1080 resolution.

The scale function in Windows could also cause problems. Try to modify or stop it to get an acceptable appearance.

**Q3: How to prepare a cell/non-cell image**

A3: You can use either commercial software or a free program to train a deep neural network to predict cell/non-cell regions. We wrote a program for training and prediction with 2D U-Net.
Find it [here](https://github.com/WenChentao/seg2link_unet2d).

**Q4: Do I need a GPU to use Seg2Link?**

A4: No. Seg2Link's core functions are realized using numpy, which only requires a CPU.

To train a deep neural network to predict cell/non-cell regions, however, you may need a GPU PC or free GPU resources like Google Colab.
